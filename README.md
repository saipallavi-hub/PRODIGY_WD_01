# 🔗 Interactive Navigation Menu

### 🎯 Internship Task - Prodigy Tech Info
This project is part of an internship assignment at **Prodigy Tech Info**. It showcases a **fixed interactive navigation menu** that enhances the user experience with dynamic scroll effects and hover interactions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📌 Features
- 📌 **Fixed Navigation Bar**  
  Stays pinned at the top of the page, always accessible to the user.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Styling on Scroll**  
  Background and text styles change smoothly when the user scrolls down.
- 🖱️ **Hover Effects**  
  Menu items respond visually with color or style changes when hovered over.
- 🧠 **JavaScript Interactivity**  
  The navigation bar dynamically detects scroll position and applies style changes in real-time.
- 💻 **Responsive Design**  
  Compatible with various screen sizes including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Structure of the navigation bar  
- **CSS3** – Styling, transitions, and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript** – Scroll detection and class toggling for interactivity


## 🚀 How It Works
1. **HTML** defines the structure of the navigation bar.
2. **CSS** applies fixed positioning and styles.
3. **JavaScript** listens for the `scroll` event and toggles a class on the navbar.
4. On scroll, background and font styles change.
5. Menu items react to hover with color changes.


## 🧪 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Scroll or hover over menu items to see interactivity in action.

- Scroll-based UI interaction using JavaScript
- Designing fixed-position responsive navigation menus
- DOM manipulation and dynamic class handling
- CSS transitions and pseudo-classes for interactivity
